## Overview
### Summary
FitDroid aims to be an all in one platform for fitness and reaching personal weight goals. Rather than having different applications to track all this correlated information, this app allows users to have one centralized place to do it. Functionality includes calorie tracking, recommended workouts, and weight tracking.

### Platforms
Android 4.0+

## Background and motivation
Many people are experiencing rising stress/anxiety levels in their daily lives that lead to a lot of serious health problems. Thus, we wanted to create an application that allows people to monitor their health in a clear and efficient manner. It would really help alleviate the stress involved with personal health if all the things the person would need to reach their fitness or personal weight goals were available in one place.

## Features
